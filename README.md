## About

**Simple Dark** is a simple dark theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It is based on the [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) theme by **Luiz de Pr√°** because of its simplicity in design. After making some changes to the theme I realized that I had changed enough to make it a new theme. So I decided to share it with the community.

## Installation

You can install the theme either as a clone or submodule if you are using git or you can download the theme as a zip file. I recommend using git to install via a submodule because it makes it easier to update the theme.

### Clone

```console
# Clone the theme to the themes directory
git clone https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/simple-dark.git themes/simple-dark
```

### Submodule

Install the theme as a submodule is preferred that way if you make changes to the theme it well not be tracked by git.

```console
# Add the theme as a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/simple-dark.git themes/simple-dark
```

## Configuration

After installing the theme you well need to configure inorder to use it. The following configuration are in `yaml` format, because I find it easier to read. If you prefer `toml` or `json` you can convert the configuration to the format you prefer.

> **NOTE:** For now the right-to-left (RTL) is not supported. I am working on adding support for RTL, but as I'm not bilingual it is taking me longer than I would like.

### Site Parameters

The following are the site parameters that you can set in the `config.yaml` file.

```yaml
# config.yaml
baseURL: "/"
title: Your site title
theme: simple-dark
languageCode: en
defaultContentLanguage: en

# How many posts to show on the home page; the default is 10 and the maximum is 100.
paginate: 20
```

### Markdown Parameters

By default [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) does not render html in markdown files. To enable html rendering you need to set the `unsafe` parameter to `true` in the `config.yaml` file. I also recommend setting the `endLevel` parameter to `4` and the `startLevel` parameter to `2` in the `config.yaml` file. This well set the table of contents to start at the `h2` level and end at the `h4` level.

```yaml
markup:
  goldmark:
    renderer:
      unsafe: true
  tableOfContents:
    endLevel: 4
    ordered: true
    startLevel: 2
  highlight:
    noClasses: false
```

### Author, Description and Keywords

The following are the author, description and keywords parameters that you can set.

```yaml
params:
  author: Your name
  description: Your site description
  keywords: Your site keywords
```

### Licensing

The theme supports link to the license type in the footer. You can set the license type and location under the `params` section.

```yaml
params:

# ---

  license:
    type: MIT
    location: link to license
```

### See Also

`maxSeeAlsoItems: 1` is the maximum number of see also items to show in the sidebar. The default is `5` and the maximum is `10`.
This is used to show series the post is part of.

Because of how posts are rendered in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) you need to add the following to the front matter of each post you want to be part of a series.

Post front matter:

```yaml
series:
  - name: Series Name
    weight: 1
```

### Custom SCSS

Using a custom `scss` maybe enabled by setting the `customSCSS` parameter to the relative path. This means the `scss` file must be in the `assets` or `static` directory. However, if you are using a `scss` file in the `assets` directory you may just want to import the `scss` file by copying the `theme/simple-dark/assets/scss/simple-dark.scss` file to your `assets/scss` directory and adding `@import "simple-dark";` at the bottom.

Keep in mind that if you do copy the file, you well need to use the same relative path as the original file. For example, `theme/simple-dark/assets/scss/simple-dark.scss` would be `assets/scss/simple-dark.scss`. Not doing so well cause the theme to not render correctly or build errors.

```yaml
params:

# ---

  customSCSS: "scss/custom.scss"
```

### Analytics

The theme supports Google Analytics, Plausible and Simple Analytics. You can enable the analytics by setting the `analytics` parameter to the name of the analytics you want to use. You can also set the `analyticsID` parameter to the ID of the analytics you want to use.

However, some hosting providers like [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) provide analytics without the need to configure with the theme, otherwise set the `analyticsID` parameter to the ID of the analytics you want to use.

- [goatCounter](https://goatcounter.com/)
  - `code: goatcounter`
- [googleAnalytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
  - `id: UA-XXXXXXXXX-X`
- [matomo](https://matomo.org/)
  - `siteID: 1`
  - `serverURL: https://example.com/matomo/`
- [yandexMetrika](https://metrika.yandex.com/)
  - `id: XXXXXXXX`
- [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
  - `id: XXXXXXXX`
- [plausibleAnalytics](https://plausible.io/)
  - `domain: example.com`
  - `serverURL: https://example.com`
  - `outboundLinksTracking: true`
  - `fileDownloadsTracking: true`
- [applicationInsights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/)
  - `connectionString: XXXXXXXX`
- [microAnalytics](https://microanalytics.io/)
  - `id: XXXXXXXX`
  - `dnt: false`
- [pirsch](https://pirsch.io/)
  - `code: XXXXXXXX`

### Content-Security-Policy

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The theme supports CSP by setting the `csp` parameter to the CSP you want to use. However, some hosting providers like [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) provide CSP without the need to configure with the theme.

This is more useful if you are hosting your site on your own server.

```yaml
params:

# ---

  csp:
    childsrc: [self]
    fontsrc: [self, https://fonts.gstatic.com, https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/]
    formaction: [self]
    framesrc: [self, https://www.youtube.com]
    imgsrc: [self]
    objectsrc: [none]
    stylesrc: [self,unsafe-inline,https://fonts.googleapis.com/,https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/]

    scriptsrc: [self,unsafe-inline,https://www.google-analytics.com,https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/]
```

You may to edit the CSP to fit your needs. For more information on CSP see [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

### Social and Contact Links

The theme uses **font awesome** icons for the social and contact links. Because of the default fonts for **smart phones** and **tablets** and older version is used, otherwise the icons well not render correctly.

Use the `social` icons that you want. For using rss feed you need to set the `rel` and `type` parameters.

```yaml
params:

---

social:
    - name: github
      icon: fa fa-2x fa-github
      url: https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/
    - name: Gitlab
      icon: fa fa-2x fa-gitlab
      url: https://gitlab.com/
    - name: Twitter
      icon: fa fa-2x fa-twitter
      url: https://twitter.com/
    - name: LinkedIn
      icon: fa fa-2x fa-linkedin
      url: https://www.linkedin.com/
    - name: Medium
      icon: fa fa-2x fa-medium
      url: https://medium.com/
    - name: RSS
      icon: fa fa-2x fa-rss
      url: https://myhugosite.com/
      rel: alternate
      type: application/rss+xml
    - name: Facebook
      icon: fa fa-2x fa-facebook-official
      url: https://www.facebook.com/
    - name: StackOverflow
      icon: fa fa-2x fa-stack-overflow
      url: https://stackoverflow.com/
    - name: Instagram
      icon: fa fa-2x fa-instagram
      url: https://www.instagram.com/
```

### Taxonomies

Taxonomies are used to group content together: the only one that is required is `series`, if using the default `layout/post/single.html`. However, you can use any taxonomy you want by setting the `taxonomies` parameter to the taxonomy you want to use.

```yaml
params:

# ---

  taxonomies:
    series: series
    tag: tags
    category: categories
    authors: authors
```

## Navigation Menu

The navigation menu is generated from the `config.yaml` file. The menu is generated from the `main` menu. You can add menu items by adding the following to the `config.yaml` file.

```yaml
params:

# ---

  menu:
    main:
      - name: Posts
        url: /posts/
      - name: Wiki
        url: /wiki/
      - name: Projects
        url: /projects/
      - name: About
        url: /about/
      - name: Contact
        url: /contact/
```
